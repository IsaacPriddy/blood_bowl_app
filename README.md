# blood_bowl_app

This is a project that I am developing with for a College class with the intent of expanding my portfolio. This app in particular is something I have interest in as it relates to a board game that I quite enjoy but do not want to carry the rules around everywhere when I want to play.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
